  <h1>Ever stop to think about the history of a public loo?</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Did you know that the public toilet is an Ancient Roman Invention? No, neither did wee...</p>
  <p>The first public toilets as we know them didn't arrive in London until 1851, imagine having to cross your legs for that long! </p>
  <p>These toilets were designed and opened for men, and it took lobbying from a newly formed group called the Ladies Sanitary Association from 1851 onwards to create public loos for women</p>

  <p>Public toilets were popularised across the city in the Victorian era, which was a huge victory for Womens' rights.</p>
  <p>Don't believe me? Read more about Women and wee

</p>
  <p>London's oldest public toilets can be found in Wesley's Chapel on City Road- they're original Crappers! </p>
  <p> Now, thanks to the Mayor of London, you can use a loo in any department store, National museum or gallery or train station for free. </p>
